# Codspeed C++

## Release

For now, releasing is done manually, by tagging a git rev with vX.Y.Z.

When releasing a new version, please make sure the version is updated in the [`core/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/CodSpeedHQ/codspeed-cpp/blob/main/core/CMakeLists.txt#L3) and [`core/BUILD`](https://github.com/CodSpeedHQ/codspeed-cpp/blob/main/core/BUILD#L4) files to match the pushed version
